# TkMusicPlayer
"Lightweight Music Player"
TkMusicPlayer is a lightweight GUI meant to be converted into a .exe file before use.
However, I have encountered problems actually executing the .exe file because of some libraries.
It still feels weird writing a README.md for some reason, so I'll make this very quick.

## Built With
- Python        (Obviously) | Tkinter, CustomTkinter, Pygame, YouTube_Search, PyTube, MoviePy, PIL (Pillow), Mutagen

## Trying Things Out
I saw memes online about every repos on GitHub not having .exe download link, and so does this one.
You can always try forking this repository and running it on your machine. "It WoRkEd On My MaChInE".
If you have issues, please report. I did not review the GUI at all.

> py main.py

## Usage?
You can use this project if you want. If you happen to copy and paste one of the very few lines of code that I wrote for myself,
Well I don't think I'll care. You can do whatever you want.
